# Folder Structure: RPGHQ Userscript Manager (Simplified)

This document outlines the simplified folder structure for the RPGHQ Userscript Manager project.

```

```

## Key Components (Simplified Structure):

- **`dist/`**: Contains the final, installable `.user.js` file generated by the Rollup build process.
- **`docs/`**: Holds project documentation, like the UI description and this structure guide.
- **`src/`**: Contains all the source code.
  - **`main.js`**: The primary script file. Handles initialization, creates the UI (modal, tabs, etc.), manages loading/saving settings via `GM_*` functions, and dynamically loads/runs enabled scripts from the `scripts/` directory based on the `manifest.js` (respecting the defined load order). It may also contain common utility functions.
  - **`scripts/`**: Each `.js` file represents a distinct userscript feature. These should ideally be self-contained or rely on minimal shared utilities defined in `main.js`.
  - **`styles.css`**: A single CSS file containing all styles for the manager's UI. Rollup will bundle this into the final script.
  - **`manifest.js`**: Defines metadata for all scripts (ID, name, description, version, category, settings definition, etc.) and crucially, **the order in which they should be loaded and executed**. This is used by `main.js` to populate the UI and manage the scripts correctly.
- **`package.json`**: Defines the project for Node.js, including development dependencies like Rollup and its plugins. Also contains build script commands.
- **`rollup.config.js`**: Configuration file for Rollup, detailing how to bundle `src/main.js`, its imports (including scripts and CSS), and produce the final userscript in `dist/`.
- **`README.md`**: Standard entry point for understanding the project, setup, and usage.

This structure consolidates core logic into `main.js`, uses a `scripts` directory for individual features, and allows for defined load ordering via the manifest.
