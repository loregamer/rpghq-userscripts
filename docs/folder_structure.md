# Folder Structure: RPGHQ Userscript Manager (Simplified)

This document outlines the simplified folder structure for the RPGHQ Userscript Manager project.

```

│   ├── styles.css            # Single CSS file for the manager UI and potentially module styles

```

## Key Components (Simplified Structure):

*   **`dist/`**: Contains the final, installable `.user.js` file generated by the Rollup build process.
*   **`docs/`**: Holds project documentation, like the UI description and this structure guide.
*   **`src/`**: Contains all the source code.
    *   **`main.js`**: The primary script file. Handles initialization, creates the UI (modal, tabs, etc.), manages loading/saving settings via `GM_*` functions, and dynamically loads/runs enabled modules from the `modules/` directory based on the `manifest.js`. It may also contain common utility functions.
    *   **`modules/`**: Each `.js` file represents a distinct userscript feature. These should ideally be self-contained or rely on minimal shared utilities defined in `main.js`.
    *   **`styles.css`**: A single CSS file containing all styles for the manager's UI. Rollup will bundle this into the final script.
    *   **`manifest.js`**: Defines metadata for all modules (ID, name, description, version, category, settings definition, etc.). This is used by `main.js` to populate the UI and manage the scripts.
*   **`package.json`**: Defines the project for Node.js, including development dependencies like Rollup and its plugins. Also contains build script commands.
*   **`rollup.config.js`**: Configuration file for Rollup, detailing how to bundle `src/main.js`, its imports (including modules and CSS), and produce the final userscript in `dist/`.
*   **`README.md`**: Standard entry point for understanding the project, setup, and usage.

This structure consolidates core logic into `main.js` and simplifies the overall layout compared to a more heavily modularized approach.
