The script scans the page for media embeds and replaces them with direct links when the corresponding setting is enabled. It uses a MutationObserver to catch dynamically added embeds.

### YouTube Embed Detection

Looks for elements with the `data-s9e-mediaembed="youtube"` attribute, extracts the video ID from the iframe src, and replaces with a direct link to the YouTube video.

### Reddit Embed Detection

Looks for iframes with the `data-s9e-mediaembed="reddit"` attribute, extracts the post path from the iframe src, and replaces with a direct link to the Reddit post.
